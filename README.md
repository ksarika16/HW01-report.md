## Git, GitHub

### Q1 - URL of GitHub Repo

https://github.com/ksarika16/HW1-report.md

### Q2 - Pull Command

The git pull command brings changes from the remote GitHub repository to my local computer. It updates my local repo with edits that were made online or on another machine.


### Q3 - Local Commits

If I make a commit on my local computer but do not see the changes on GitHub.com, it means I forgot to use the git push command. Without pushing, the changes remain only on my computer.
